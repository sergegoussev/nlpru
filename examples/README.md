# Examples and explantions of the library

The following examples/walkthroughs can help understand the library and how it works"
* [Categorizing topics (basic)](nlpru_topic_categorization_walkthrough.ipynb) -- use keywords to find which tweets can be categorized as about a topic
* [Adding conversation thread effects to topic modeling](Categorizing_by_topic_using_conversation_threads.ipynb) -- walkthrough why simple topic categorzation is not enough

For more information on the data collected and used in these examples, see our paper [*"Kremlin Tweets: the politics of social media and the quest for legitimacy in Putin’s Russia"*](https://www.rudatalab.com/analysis/).

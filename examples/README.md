# Examples and explantions of the library

The following examples/walkthroughs can help understand the library and how it works:

**Conceptual examples**:
* [Simple overview of topic categorization with conversation thread affects](Topic_and_conversation_thread_categorization_simple.ipynb)

**Full walkthroughs and real data applications**:
* [Categorizing tweets by topic](nlpru_topic_categorization_walkthrough.ipynb) -- use keywords to find which tweets can be categorized as about a topic
* [Categorizing tweets by topic, but also adding conversation thread effects to topic modeling](Categorizing_by_topic_using_conversation_threads.ipynb) -- walkthrough why simple topic categorzation is not enough

For more information on the data collected and used in these examples, see our paper [*"Kremlin Tweets: the politics of social media and the quest for legitimacy in Putinâ€™s Russia"*](https://www.rudatalab.com/analysis/).

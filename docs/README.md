# welcome to the *nlpru* documenation

WIP

## Installation

The *nplru* library is not yet availible via *Pypi*, hence to install it, it has to be downloaded from this gitab repository. This means there are two ways to do it

## Methods

The following methods are availible:
* [Semantics](methods.md#semantics)
* [Preprocessing](methods.md#rpeprocessing)
* [Topic Analysis](methods.md#topicanalysis)
* [Adding Conversation thread effects to Topic Analysis](methods/#addconversationaffectstotopics)
